## Overview

- Another week another challenge. This time I decided to do something with some javascript. The aim was to create a landing page for a fashion brand.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

This time I decided to begin with desktop first approach since it was easier to visualize where everything would go in the grid. The page is built using css grid. I chose this because some elements would be moving around in different screen sizes and this would make it easier to position items. I use SCSS to compile my CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
